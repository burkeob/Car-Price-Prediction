# Car-Price-Prediction
Repository for my Fall 2022 DATA1030 project, predicting the list price of used Audis in the UK.

The enviroment in which this project was conducted is also included in the YAML file. 

Includes EDA, Preprocessing, and Modeling notebooks. The data for this project are from a public-use dataset on Kaggle. I was only able to upload my Lasso, Ridge, and EN models- the others were too large to upload to Github. I also include my final report write-up.
